# Anxiety-Attack-Capstone-project
Anxiety Attack Dataset:
The goal of this project is to analyze and predict the severity of anxiety attacks based on various psychological and physiological factors using machine learning techniques.

# Steps followed to analyse the data:
1. Import all the necessary libraries for the data analysis.
2. Load the data in csv format
3. After that take the all detail about the data including the rowas and columns.
4. Check the null values, duplicates.
5. Find out the outliers and by using IQR method we cleaned the outliers.
6. Done the visualisation for getting a ocerall idea about the data and their features.

# Machine Learning:
1. For machine learning first we encode the data, we have some categorical and boolean columns.
2. By using one-hot we done that.
3. Split the data for testing and training
4. Standardisation will done after that.
5. We used models like logistic regression,knn,Decision tree,SVM,Random forest,Gradient boosting,GaussianGB.
6. KNN is the model that gave a better accuracy for the data.
7. Hyper parameter tunining done for the knn model and predict the data.
